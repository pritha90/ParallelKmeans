Complexity of sequential K-Means algorithm: O(N*D*K*T)
N: # of datas.
D: # of dimension.
K: # of clusters.
T: # of iterations.

Complexity of each iteration step:

Part1: for each data point, compute the distance with K cluster centers and assign to the nearest one.  O(N*D*K)                                  
Parallelize on CUDA (SIMD: single instruction multiple data)

Part2: compute the new center as mean of new cluster datas. O((N+K)*D)--> O((2*delta+K)*D)
delta: #of membership change.
